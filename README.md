ASP.NET Web API Project
This project is an ASP.NET Web API application developed using .NET Core. It provides a robust and scalable backend solution for building RESTful APIs to serve data to client applications.

Features

Generic Repository Pattern: Utilizes the generic repository pattern to provide a consistent interface for data access, making it easier to manage and maintain data operations.
Dependency Injection (DI): Implements dependency injection to promote loose coupling and facilitate unit testing by providing more control over object creation and lifetime management.
Unit of Work: Implements the Unit of Work pattern to manage transactions and ensure data consistency across multiple database operations.
ASP.NET Identity: Integrates ASP.NET Identity for user authentication and authorization, providing features such as user registration, login, roles, and claims management.
Swagger/OpenAPI Documentation: Includes Swagger/OpenAPI documentation to automatically generate interactive API documentation, making it easy for developers to explore and test endpoints.
Logging and Error Handling: Implements logging and error handling to track application events and exceptions, aiding in troubleshooting and debugging.

Technologies Used

ASP.NET Core: The framework for building cross-platform, high-performance web applications.
Entity Framework Core: The object-relational mapper (ORM) for .NET Core, used for database access and management.
Swagger/OpenAPI: The tool for documenting and interacting with RESTful APIs.
ASP.NET Identity: The membership system for ASP.NET applications, used for user authentication and authorization.
